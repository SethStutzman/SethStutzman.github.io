    "text": "No question, Nebraska is a streaky team. Is PBA the reason for this?\nAnyone who has kept up with Nebraska Basketball over the last six years knows that Fred Hoiberg’s teams have gotten progressively better year after year, aside from maybe this last season, but that’s besides the point.\nAs his teams have improved over the course of his time at Nebraska, there is one thing that each team seems to have in common…STREAKINESS!\nTo Nebraska basketball fans, Coach Hoiberg is becoming notorious for situations such as this season when they lost on the road to the last ranked team in the Big Ten, Penn State, and then less than a week later, nearly beat the first ranked team in the conference at home, Michigan. Or last year when they upset the number one team in the nation at the time, Purdue, and then a few days later lost on the road to an Iowa team who finished 10-10 in the Big Ten.\nThere’s no question that Pinnacle Bank Arena has provided Fred Hoiberg with a major home-court advantage. With its electric atmosphere of faithful Nebraska fans and its overwhelming energy during close games, PBA seems to have become a dreadful stop on opposing teams’ schedules.\nThe question is, how much home-court advantage has PBA given Fred Hoiberg since he took the head coaching job back in 2019? What does the data say? How different of a team does Coach Hoiberg have from going on the road to playing in Lincoln?\nTo understand this more, let’s look at Nebraska’s total wins overall the last six seasons and the difference of wins on the road and wins at home.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(hoopR)\nlibrary (ggplot2)\n\n\nTeamData &lt;- load_mbb_team_box(2019:2025)\n\n\nNeb &lt;- TeamData |&gt;\n  group_by(team_short_display_name, season) |&gt;\n  mutate(team_winner = as.numeric(team_winner, season = as.numeric(season))) |&gt;\n  select(team_home_away, team_winner, team_score, field_goal_pct, opponent_team_short_display_name, team_score, free_throw_pct, three_point_field_goal_pct) |&gt;\n  filter(team_short_display_name == \"Nebraska\")\n\n\nTotalWins &lt;- Neb |&gt;\n  group_by(team_home_away, season) |&gt;\n  summarize(TotalWins = sum(team_winner))\n\n\nggplot(TotalWins, aes(x = season, y = TotalWins, fill = team_home_away)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\", width = .75) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"home\" = \"red\", \"away\" = \"black\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Season\", y = \"Number of Wins\", fill = \"\",\n    title = \"Nebraska Basketball Home Wins vs Road Wins \\n Under Fred Hoiberg\",\n    subtitle = \"The Huskers continually succeed more at Pinnacle Bank Arena\",\n    caption = \"By: Seth Stutzman | Source: hoopR: The SportsDataverse's R Package for Men's Basketball Data\"\n  ) +\n    theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 18, hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(face = \"italic\", size = 14, hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.caption = element_text(face = \"italic\", size = 8),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(face = \"italic\", size = 12),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),\n    legend.position = \"top\" \n  ) +\n   scale_x_continuous(\n    breaks = c(2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025),\n    limits = c(2018.5, 2025.5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy simply looking over the data of the Cornhuskers’ total wins, it is clear to see that since Fred Hoiberg has taken over, Nebraska has had much more success playing at Pinnacle Bank Arena.\nBased on the chart above, we should have a pretty good idea of how different their home winning percentage is from their road winning percentage. To better visualize it though, let’s compare each winning percentage to their total winning percentage of each season.\n\n\nCode\ntotalwp &lt;- Neb |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    TotalWins = sum(team_winner),\n    TotalGames = n()\n  ) |&gt;\n  group_by(season, team_short_display_name) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    TotalWinPercentage = TotalWins / TotalGames)\n\n\nhomewp &lt;- Neb |&gt;\n  filter(team_home_away == \"home\") |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    TotalWins = sum(team_winner),\n    TotalGames = n()\n  ) |&gt;\n  group_by(season, team_short_display_name) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    TotalWinPercentage = TotalWins / TotalGames)\n\n\nroadwp &lt;- Neb |&gt;\n  filter(team_home_away == \"away\") |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    TotalWins = sum(team_winner),\n    TotalGames = n()\n  ) |&gt;\n  group_by(season, team_short_display_name) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    TotalWinPercentage = TotalWins / TotalGames)\n\n\ntotalwp &lt;- totalwp |&gt; mutate(Type = \"Total Win Percentage\")\nhomewp &lt;- homewp |&gt; mutate(Type = \"Home Win Percentage\")\nroadwp &lt;- roadwp |&gt; mutate(Type = \"Road Win Percentage\")\n\n\nwin_data &lt;- bind_rows(totalwp, homewp, roadwp)\n\n\nggplot(win_data, aes(x = season, y = TotalWinPercentage, color = Type, group = interaction(team_short_display_name, Type))) +\n  geom_line(size = 1, aes(linetype = Type)) +\n  geom_point(size = 2) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\n    \"Total Win Percentage\" = \"black\",\n    \"Home Win Percentage\" = \"red\",\n    \"Road Win Percentage\" = \"grey\"\n  )) +\n  scale_linetype_manual(values = c(\n    \"Total Win Percentage\" = 1,\n    \"Home Win Percentage\" = 1,\n    \"Road Win Percentage\" = 1)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 1), labels = scales::percent) +\n  labs(\n    y = \"Win Percentage\",\n    x = \"Season\",\n    color = \"\",\n    linetype = \"\",\n    title = \"Fred Hoiberg's Cornhuskers Consistently Have a \\nHigher Win Percentage at Home\",\n    subtitle = \"Pinnacle Bank Arena has brought Nebraska much success\",\n    caption = \"By: Seth Stutzman | Source: hoopR: The SportsDataverse's R Package for Men's Basketball Data\"\n  ) +\n     theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10, face = \"italic\"),\n    plot.caption = element_text(face = \"italic\", size = 8),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8, face = \"bold\"),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    legend.position = \"right\"\n  ) +\n     scale_x_continuous(\n    breaks = c(2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025),\n    limits = c(2019, 2025))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, Fred Hoiberg’s Cornhuskers have continually had significantly more success playing in Lincoln. Aside from the 2020 season, their winning percentage on the road is much lower and supports the claim that Nebraska is a streaky team nearly every year.\nSomething else that could be helpful to look at to see how much Pinnacle Bank Arena has provided a home-court advantage is their offensive play. There are multiple statistics that would be good to look at, but to keep it simple, let’s look at what their field goal percentage has been and the total points they have scored on the road versus at home.\n\n\nCode\nNebAlt &lt;- TeamData |&gt;\n  group_by(team_short_display_name, season) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    team_winner = as.numeric(team_winner),\n    season = as.numeric(season),\n    field_goal_pct = field_goal_pct / 100\n) |&gt;\n  select(team_home_away, team_winner, team_score, field_goal_pct, opponent_team_short_display_name, team_score, free_throw_pct, three_point_field_goal_pct) |&gt;\n  filter(team_short_display_name == \"Nebraska\")\n\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data = NebAlt, aes(x = team_score, y = field_goal_pct, color = team_home_away)) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"home\" = \"red\", \"away\" = \"black\")) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +\n    theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    y = \"Field Goal Percentage\",\n    x = \"Points Scored\",\n    color = \"\",\n    title = \"Nebraska's Offense at Home vs Away Under Fred Hoiberg\",\n    subtitle = \"The Huskers seem to have a slight offensive edge in Pinnacle Bank Arena\",\n    caption = \"By: Seth Stutzman | Source: hoopR: The SportsDataverse's R Package for Men's Basketball Data\"  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10, face = \"italic\"),\n    plot.caption = element_text(face = \"italic\", size = 8),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8, face = \"bold\"),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile a little harder to see, there does appear to be a difference in shooting and overall scoring. It’s not by much, by I would say that more of the games Nebraska is shooting better and scoring more are the games that take place in Lincoln.\nWe may never really know why Pinnacle Bank Arena has provided Fred Hoiberg with such a massive home-court advantage, but the data shows that it definitely does. So even though this season didn’t end the way the Huskers wanted it to, there’s always next year! And as long as Nebraska has more home games on the schedule than away games, Coach Hoiberg can count on a winning season."

    "text": "“Defense wins championships,” they say. But how true is this statement? Do championship teams actually have top tier defenses? Let’s look at NCAA men’s basketball data from the past five years to find out.\nThe month of March is a time every year that is highly anticipated for college basketball fans. March Madness is a tournament that reveals the best programs in the country. Teams go head to head until the best one is standing in the NCAA National Championship.\nBut what contributes the most to the success of these teams that make deep runs in the tournament? Is it an efficient offense or is it a lock down defense? If defense wins championships, the teams that go far should have some of the top defenses in the country.\nTo look more into this, let’s look at where the Final Four teams from the last five years

Knowing this, it would appear that offense and defense evenly contribute to a team’s success. But let’s keep looking into the defensive side of the ball to find out more.\nNow we will take a look at where championship teams rank in the country. Defensive efficiency measures how many points a team gives up every 100 possessions. Teams with a lower defensive efficiency have more success on the defensive side of the ball.

them landing inside the top 10. This is helpful because it suggests that teams who are good enough to win championships consistently hold their opponents to lower scores.\nRebounding is a huge part of basketball. Teams that can pull down more rebounds are more likely to have more success overall. Knowing this, let’s look at how these championship teams rank in rebounding on the defensive side compared to the Big Ten, Pac 12, SEC, ACC, Big 12, and Big East champions of that given year.\n\n\nCode\navg_21_reb &lt;- totalcollegedata |&gt;\n  group_by(team_short_display_name, season) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    AvgDefRebounds = mean(defensive_rebounds, na.rm = TRUE),\n  ) |&gt;\n
